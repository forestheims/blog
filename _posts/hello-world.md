## My First Next.js App

I used the Blog Starter Kit accessible here: [https://vercel.com/new/templates/next.js/blog-starter-kit](https://vercel.com/new/templates/next.js/blog-starter-kit)

> "This is the existing blog-starter plus TypeScript.
>
> This example showcases Next.js's Static Generation feature using Markdown files as the data source.
>
> The blog posts are stored in /\_posts as Markdown files with front matter support. Adding a new Markdown file in there will create a new blog post.
>
> To create the blog posts we use remark and remark-html to convert the Markdown files into an HTML string, and then send it down as a prop to the page. The metadata of every post is handled by gray-matter and also sent in props to the page."

To bootstrap the same example template, run this command in the terminal:

`npx create-next-app --example blog-starter blog-starter-app`
