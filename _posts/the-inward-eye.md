## I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud

### _also known as 'Daffodils'_

### - William Wordsworth, 1770 – 1850

I wandered lonely as a cloud\
That floats on high o’er vales and hills,\
When all at once I saw a crowd,\
A host, of golden daffodils;\
Beside the lake, beneath the trees,\
Fluttering and dancing in the breeze.

Continuous as the stars that shine\
And twinkle on the Milky Way,\
They stretched in never-ending line\
Along the margin of a bay:\
Ten thousand saw I at a glance,\
Tossing their heads in sprightly dance.

The waves beside them danced, but they\
Out-did the sparkling waves in glee:\
A Poet could not but be gay,\
In such a jocund company:\
I gazed—and gazed—but little thought\
What wealth the show to me had brought:

For oft, when on my couch I lie\
In vacant or in pensive mood,\
They flash upon that inward eye\
Which is the bliss of solitude;\
And then my heart with pleasure fills,\
And dances with the daffodils.
